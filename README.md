# BlockShuffle
 Original idea by Dream/GeorgeNotFound, Original code by GeorgeNotFound, modified by devvydont

## Commands
- `/blockshuffle start` starts the game for all players in the server
- `/blockshuffle tpstart` same as start, except it teleports all players to a random location in the world. This is convenient as you do not have to restart the server and delete the world after consecutive sessions
- `/blockshuffle pause` pauses the timer if a block shuffle game is currently running
- `/blockshuffle stop` stops the game if it is in progress
